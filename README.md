# Deploying Machine Learning Models to the Web

One essential and last phase of the¬†CRISP-DM data framework is¬†deployment. The key focus in this phase is the usability of the developed model by intended users or customers. Depending on the type of solution and use case, this can involve deploying and integrating the model on any medium like the web, a mobile application, a hardware-embedded system, etc. While this might "sound easy,‚Äù many beginner ML engineers find it daunting to deploy their projects on the web for their intended users to test and for their solutions to solve their users' problems.

In this workshop, Bolaji will introduce you to ML model deployment by showing you the steps and processes involved with turning a machine learning model into an API with Python and Flask, testing the API, building a web application, and deploying it to the cloud for global usage. We would also discuss several other alternative JavaScript frameworks and tools you can consider.

This repository contains the workshop materials, lesson notes, machine learning model notebook, serilized model, web application code, and links to further resources. You can follow the workshop lessons and build the project yourself or use the materials to learn at your own pace.

In this workshop, we will build the following:

- A simple machine learning model that predicts the personality type of an individual based off their messages in conversations using Python, Scikit-learn, and other libraries.
- A web application and API that consumes the model using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask.
- A web application and API that consumes the model using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Nextjs, and Flask.
- A web application and API that consumes the model using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and FastAPI.
- A web application and API that consumes the model using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Nextjs, and FastAPI.
- An AI web application using Nextjs and OpenAPI.

This workshop has been presented at the following events:

- [React Alicante 2023](https://reactalicante.es/) in Alicante, Spain üá™üá∏.
- Your next event or conference? You can invite me by [sending a message](https://twitter.com/iambolajiayo).

## üõ† Prerequisites and Installation Guide

Generally, you need the following:

- A curious mind and desire to learn.
- An understanding of or familiarity with the first five phases of the CRISP-DM data-mining framework.
- A working laptop running on any operating system (Windows, Linux, or macOS).
- Ability to navigate through the command-line interface (CLI).
- Some existing machine learning model development knowledge (or an interest at least).
- Some basic understanding of the Python programming language.
- Some basic understanding of the JavaScript programming language.
- Experience using Reactjs and Nextjs frameworks.

To make the workshop a smooth process, we will use [Google Colab](https://colab.google?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop) for the machine learning model development. This will enable us to run a hosted Jupyter Notebook on the cloud (with GPU and TPU computing resources) and avoid issues with installing all the Python packages locally (the future is cloud!). All you have to do is create a free Google account if you don't have one already and open the Notebook in Google Colab.

But if you prefer local (I strongly advise against this; at least for this workshop), you should install [Anancoda](https://anaconda.com/download?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop) to use Jupyter Notebook on your local computer. You will need to install and import all the required packages yourself too and resolve any conflicts that might arise.

> **Note**
>
> [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop) allow you to combine executable code and rich text in a single document, along with images, HTML, LaTeX and more.
