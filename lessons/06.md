## Overview

So far, we have successfully built the machine learning model using Python and Sckit-Learn, a simple API using Flask, and a web application using Flask. In this lesson, we will discuss an alternative way of building a hybrid Nextjs + Python web application using the same Flask API as the backend but with Nextjs as the frontend. During the workshop, we will discuss how this works in detail.

## Getting Started

To get started, kindly follow the steps below:

1. Run the command below to start a project using Vercel's Nextjs Flask starter. This will download the files and install all the packages required.

```bash
npx create-next-app nextjs-flask-app --example "https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/python/nextjs-flask"
```

2. Create a `.env` file and add `FLASK_DEBUG=1`. This will allow us to run Flask in debug mode and automatically reload the server when changes are made to the code.

3. Update the `requirements.txt` file to the following:

```text
Flask==2.3.3
scikit-learn==1.3.1
```

3. Copy the `model.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl` files in the root [`model/two`](../model/two/) directory to the newly created Nextjs app (`app/nextjs-flask-app/model/` in my case).

4. Now start the development server using the command below:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the Flask server on `http://127.0.0.1:5328` and Nextjs on `http://localhost:3000`.

## How it Works

The Python Flask server is mapped into Nextjs from the `/api/` directory. This is implemented using `next.config.js` rewrites, which maps any request to `/api/:path*` to the Flask API. So, Flask will receive the API request and return a response as usual, and the response can be handled in Nextjs as desired.

```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  rewrites: async () => {
    return [
      {
        source: '/api/:path*',
        destination:
          process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
            ? 'http://127.0.0.1:5328/api/:path*'
            : '/api/',
      },
    ]
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

<br />

> [!NOTE]
>
> On localhost, the rewrite is made to the `127.0.0.1:5328` port, where the Flask server runs. While in production, the Flask server is hosted as Python serverless functions.

<br />

We will then add our Flask backend code to the `/api/index.py` file, create a `/api/predict` route and return the data as JSON. The response data will then be handled in the Nextjs frontend and displayed to the user.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, redirect, url_for, jsonify
import pickle

#¬†Create an instance of the Flask class
# with the name of the application‚Äôs modules
app = Flask(__name__, template_folder='templates')

# Create the / API route to return a welcome message
@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def main():
    return jsonify({
            "description": "Welcome to the MBPTI API!",
            "message": "Please use the form on the Nextjs frontend (http://localhost:3000)"
        })

# Create the /predict API route
@app.route('/api/predict', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def predict():
    # Use pickle to load in vectorizer.
    with open(f'./model/vectorizer.pkl', 'rb') as f: 
        vectorizer = pickle.load(f)

    # Use pickle to load in the pre-trained model.
    with open(f'./model/model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
        model = pickle.load(f)

    if request.method == 'POST':
        name = request.form['name']
        country = request.form['country']
        message = request.form['message']

        mbpti_types = {
            0: "ENFJ (Extroversion, Intuition, Feeling, Judging)",
            1: "ENFP (Extroversion, Intuition, Feeling, Perceiving)",
            2: "ENTJ (Extroversion, Intuition, Thinking, Judging)",
            3: "ENTP (Extroversion, Intuition, Thinking, Perceiving)",
            4: "ESFJ (Extroversion, Sensing, Feeling, Judging)",
            5: "ESFP (Extroversion, Sensing, Feeling, Perceiving)",
            6: "ESTJ (Extroversion, Sensing, Thinking, Judging)",
            7: "ESTP (Extroversion, Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving)",
            8: "INFJ (Introversion, Intuition, Feeling, Judging)",
            9: "INFP (Introversion, Intuition, Feeling, Perceiving)",
            10: "INTJ (Introversion, Intuition, Thinking, Judging)",
            11: "INTP (Introversion, Intuition, Thinking, Perceiving)",
            12: "ISFJ (Introversion, Sensing, Feeling, Judging)",
            13: "ISFP (Introversion, Sensing, Feeling, Perceiving)",
            14: "ISTJ (Introversion, Sensing, Thinking, Judging)",
            15: "ISTP (Introversion, Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving)"
        }

        prediction = model.predict(vectorizer.transform([message]))
        result = mbpti_types[prediction[0]]

    else:
        return(redirect(url_for('main')))

    return({
        "name": name,
        "country": country,
        "prediction": result,
    })

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

Finally, we will use a form to send the request using Fetch API and handle the response.

```javascript
export default function Home() {
  const [predictionData, setPredictionData] = useState<PredictionData | null>(
    null
  );

  async function handleSubmit(event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
    event.preventDefault();

    const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget);
    await fetch("/api/predict", {
      method: "POST",
      body: formData,
    }).then(async (response) => {
      setPredictionData(await response.json());
    });
  }

  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <div className="relative flex place-items-center">
        {predictionData === null ? (
          <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
        ) : (
          <Result {...predictionData} />
        )}
      </div>
      <Footer />
    </main>
  );
}
```
