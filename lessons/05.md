## Overview

So far, we have successfully built the machine learning model using Python and Sckit-Learn and a simple API using Flask. In this lesson, we will discuss alternative approaches, technologies, and frameworks you can use to do all we have built. During the workshop, we will discuss some of the use cases and the pros/cons.

## ML Model Frameworks

| Framework |  Creator(s) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop) | Google | An end-to-end machine learning platform for creating production-grade machine learning models built with C++ and Python. It has a comprehensive set of [tools](https://tensorflow.org/resources/tools?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop), [libraries](https://tensorflow.org/resources/libraries-extensions?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop), and [pre-trained models](https://tfhub.dev?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop) you can use to build machine-learning-powered applications. Some of the notable Tensorflow libraries are: [TensorFlow.js](https://tensorflow.org/js?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop)‚Äîfor creating machine learning models with JavaScript; [Tensorflow Lite](https://tensorflow.org/lite?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop)‚Äîfor mobile and embedded devices like Android, iOS, Edge TPU, and Raspberry Pi, and [Tensorflow TFX](https://tensorflow.org/tfx?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop)‚Äîfor deploying production ML pipelines.  |
| [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop) | Meta AI | A machine learning framework for building deep learning models on irregular input data built with Python and C++. It has a [comprehensive set of tools and libraries](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop), and [tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop) you can use to build machine-learning-powered applications. |
| [Keras](https://keras.io) | Google | A neural-network deep-learning API designed for human beings that offers consistent and simple APIs built using Python. It has a comprehensive set of [guides](https://keras.io/guides?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop) and [examples](https://keras.io/examples?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop) you can use to build machine-learning-powered applications. |
| [Apache MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org) | Apache | A deep learning framework designed for both efficiency and flexibility for deep neural networks built using C++ and Python. It has a comprehensive set of [tutorials](https://mxnet.apache.org/api?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop) and [libraries](https://mxnet.apache.org/ecosystem?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop) you can use to build machine-learning-powered applications. |
| [The Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)](https://onnx.ai?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop) | Meta and Microsoft | An open ecosystem that empowers AI developers to choose the right tools as their project evolves with open source format for AI models (both deep learning and traditional ML). It has a comprehensive set of [tutorials](https://github.com/onnx/tutorials?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop), [Pre-trained ONNX models](https://github.com/onnx/models) and [framework/converters](https://onnx.ai/supported-tools.html?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop) you can use to build machine-learning-powered applications. |

## Model Serilization Libraries

| Library | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Joblib (`.joblib`)](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/joblib.dump.html?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop) | Like Pickle, this is used to serilize Python objects (mostly Sckit-Learn models). |
| [Hierarchical Data Format 5‚ÄîHDF5 (`.h5`)](https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop) | Mostly used for Tensorflow models. |
| [Keras v3 Format (`.keras`)](https://tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_load#save_the_entire_model?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop) | Mostly used for Keras models. |
| [Keras SavedModel Format](https://tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_load#save_the_entire_model?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop) | Mostly used for Keras models. |
| JSON/YAML | Mostly used for Keras models. |

## Python Web Server (API) Frameworks

| Framework | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Django](https://djangoproject.com?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop) | A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.   |
| [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com?utm_source=ba-deploy-ml-web-workshop) | A modern, fast, web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.  |
